    "OK, so there's lots of things we can do with the dataset given that it's a full 335 rows with 55 columns of descriptive text data each. Let's start by coming up with some basic questions we want answered:\n",
    "- What kinds of weapons are most popular, and where?\n",
    "- Where are guns most readily accessible in the country?\n",
    "- How do warning signs change with age and other factors?\n",
    "- Does lethality change with age?\n",
    "- Have shootings become, on the whole, more lethal over time?\n",
    "- How do the number of fatalities compare to the total number of victims?\n",
    "- Has the number of guns used in a shooting changed on average over time?\n",
    "- What happens to the shooter, and how does that change with age and race? Does their fate change substantially in incidences of school shootings?\n",
    "- How do the motivations of mass shooters differ with geography?\n",
    "- Does military experience alter the motive?"
