    "OK, so there's lots of things we can do with the dataset given that it's a full 335 rows with 55 columns of descriptive text data each. Let's start by coming up with some basic questions we want answered:\n",
    "- What kinds of weapons are most popular, and where?\n",
    "- Where are guns most readily accessible in the country?\n",
    "- How do warning signs change with age and other factors?\n",
    "- Does lethality change with age?\n",
    "- Have shootings become, on the whole, more lethal over time?\n",
    "- How do the number of fatalities compare to the total number of victims?\n",
    "- Has the number of guns used in a shooting changed on average over time?\n",
    "- What happens to the shooter, and how does that change with age and race? Does their fate change substantially in incidences of school shootings?\n",
    "- How do the motivations of mass shooters differ with geography?\n",
    "- Does military experience alter the motive?"

    "- 37 of the 335 incidents in question involved a shooter with military experience (~11%).\n",
    "    - According to an analysis by FiveThirtyEight, it's estimated that 7.3% of all living Americans served in the armed forces.\n",
    "    - I'm going to chalk up that gap in percentage of shooters relative to the overall population to small sample size. There's no way to know exactly how many mass shootings have occurred since 1960, but if we had all of them then I'd guess that this gap would shrink.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **In 64.8% of incidents where the shooter had military experience, they died on the scene**\n",
    "    - That's a huge uptick from the general case: 43.4% of all shooters die on the scene\n",
    "    - 39.7% of shooters with no military experience die on the scene\n",
    "    - According to the Fisher test, our p-value for that difference is .004469; *very* statistically significant.\n",
    "    - Military experience seems to be a large contributing factor in why someone would die taking a final stand.\n",
    "    - In 79% of these cases, no officers were injured or killed. How did these guys provoke the cops to the point where they were killed on the spot without actually injuring or killing any of them?\n",
    "    \n",
    "- 81% of cases w/ military experience result in officer injury or death\n",
    "    - General case: 91.6% of cases result in no enforcement injuries or deaths\n",
    "    - But again, a 10% shift in this subset is a matter of 3-4 cases, probably not enough to go off of\n",
    "    - In any event, it's surprising that a mass shooter with military experience wouldn't target law enforcement if their actions are in any way related to an institutional resentment\n",
    "        - But then again I should probably drill down into that; what were the motives for the military guys?"
